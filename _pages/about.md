I love iOS and firmware development. I'm not really big on web development. This was pretty painless. Want something like this for yourself? <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> is a good place to start.

#### The Blog
I'm a software developer from Raleigh, NC. This is where I put things that I want to share and remember later.

#### The Author
I've been an iOS developer for various startups since 2011. I cut my teeth on C and C++ a long time ago. Object Oriented Programming was a new-ish thing. I majored in Computer Science. The bubble burst. I majored in everything else. I decided I should graduate. I got an internship. I wrote myself into obsolescence with a C# utility. I majored in CSC again. I got a job developing mobile games. I joined a startup as the sole iOS dev. I took a wrong turn into SEO. I joined my current startup as the second iOS dev. I decided to start a blog.

And here I am.

More recently, I've been trying to wrap my head around functional programming since it's become a new-ish thing for mainstream languages. And by "it's become a new-ish thing for mainstream languages", I mean "Apple released Swift, which employs functional concepts". I admit my propensity for being an [Architecture Astronaut](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html), but [since OOP seems to be losing favor](http://www.smashcompany.com/technology/object-oriented-programming-is-an-expensive-disaster-which-must-end), I don't feel quite so bad for not having read the entirety of the Gang of Four book. On the other hand, [MVVM is just finding its way to the iOS world](http://www.objc.io/issue-13/mvvm.html), so I'm trying to stay at least in the stratosphere with it.

Even more recently than that, I've been learning how to write embedded software and have been loving it. Modern C++ almost seems like a new language, and the challenge of highly constrained resources makes the thrill of working code even more exciting. The descent to bare metal has been an eye-opening experience in many ways -- peeling back the "black magic" of the build toolchain and learning to truly understand the build process has reminded me of learning to write code for the first time all over again. It has also made me see what I once considered "low-level" in iOS development as a floating island somewhere in the stratosphere when compared to high-frequency clock interrupts and communication over SPI. That said, I love being in both worlds, and I love the new world in between with all of its possibilities that I've only just discovered.

If you made it this far, thanks, and I hope you find something interesting here.
